                    "2. GDPR's stringent data protection standards limit AI model training data availability. Companies now turn to synthetic data generation and anonymization techniques. #AIPrivacy #DataProtection",
                    "3. EU regulations require high-risk AI systems to undergo thorough risk assessments, regular audits, and impact assessments. Increased accountability in AI development. #AIEthics #ResponsibleAI",
                    "4. Transparency is key: EU regulations demand AI systems provide clear, understandable explanations of their decisions. This pushes for more interpretable AI models. #ExplainableAI #AITransparency",
                    "5. The upcoming EU AI Act will require registration of high-impact AI systems in an EU database. Serious incidents must be reported to the European Commission. #AIGovernance #EUAIAct",
                    "6. Data anonymization techniques like synthetic data generation and differential privacy are crucial for AI model training while preserving data utility. #DataAnonymization #AIPrivacy",
                    "7. Balancing act: Anonymization techniques can affect AI model performance. Combination of methods needed to maintain accuracy while protecting privacy. #AIAccuracy #PrivacyPreservingAI",
                    "8. Deep neural networks more sensitive to anonymization-induced noise than traditional ML models. Additional techniques may be needed to mitigate effects. #DeepLearning #AIRobustness",
                    "9. EU regulations aim to protect individual rights and ensure responsible AI development. They provide a framework for building trust in AI systems globally. #TrustworthyAI #AIEthics",
                    "10. The EU's strict AI regulations present challenges but also opportunities for innovation in privacy-preserving AI techniques and ethical AI development. #AIInnovation #EthicalAI"
